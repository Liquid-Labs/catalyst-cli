    note:${reset} The tool does not currently check whether the project is linked with other projects.
  ${underline}import${reset} <package or URL>: Imports the indicated package into your
    playground. By default, the first arguments are understood as NPM package names and the URL
    will be retrieved via 'npm view'. If the '--url' option is specified, then the arguments are
    understood to be git repo URLs, which should contain a 'package.json' file in the repository
    root.
  ${underline}create${reset} [--type|-t <bare|lib|model|api|webapp>|| --template|-T <package name|git URL>] [--origin|-o <url>] <project name>:
    Creates a new Liquid project from one of the standard types or the given template URL. When the 'bare'
    type is specified, 'origin' must be specified. The project is initially cloned from the template, and then
    re-oriented to the project origin, unless the type is 'bare' in which case the project is cloned directly
    from the origin URL. Use 'liq project import' to import an existing project from a URL.
  ${underline}public${reset}: Performs verification tests, updates package version, and publishes package.
  ${underline}save${reset}: Pushes local changes to the project remotes.
